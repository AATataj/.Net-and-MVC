# .Net-and-MVC
just practicing my web dev
Basically, the goal is to utilize the database from my Fantasy AI, to display NBA statistics.  Features will include:
1.  a login feature for those wishing to push data to the database
2.  using forms to compile queries of the database and return results
3.  patch in a decent looking front end with react
4.  *MAYBE* do some data visualization of some more in-depth stats (shot charts, heatmaps etc) if I find a decent library
    and can resist the drive to going back to my fantasy AI bot and continuing to work on that instead.
